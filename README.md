# Tech-Degree-Project-4-OOP-Game-Show-App

Hi there, I'm going for extra credit:

-I added keyboard functionality. Adding keydown event listener in app.js file.

I've made the project my own by:

-Adding animation to <h2> title in start and winning screens.
-Changing background colors of .start, .win, , lose and body.
-Changing font in <h1>, <h2> and button reset.
-Changing backround color of reset button.
-Changing background color and font color in .hide and .show elements
-Adding flip animation to .show.
